# Investigation-of-Impact-Behaviour-for-Different-Types-of-Lattice-Meta-materials
The project analyzes the impact behavior of lattice meta-materials using **FEA**, focusing on octet, re-entrant, and honeycomb geometries. It highlights their energy absorption, deformation, and stress distribution, with applications in **aerospace**, **automotive**, and **biomedical** fields.
